# KudProject's local_manifests

These are my personal local manifests that could be used when syncing ROM sources. For comfortability when syncing across multiple ROM sources, manifests are splitted into multiple files. Adjustments may or may not be needed depending on what are you doing.

## Warning!

Don't use these manifests if you don't know what are you doing. May eat your cat, home, waifu or husbando, and even your server.

## How to use?

Copy one or some of these manifests to `.repo/local_manifests` folder of your source directory (create it if it doesn't exist), then do `repo sync`. Expect some issues if it happens!
